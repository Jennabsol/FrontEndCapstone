<h2>Child List</h2>


<!-- Notice anything strange about the anchor tag there?
            That's a strange looking URL for the href property. Well, since you're now starting the process
            of building a SPA, then you don't want any link to actually refresh the browser, and so by prepending
            the new location with #, you ensure that. You'll see this in action as we set up the routing. -->
